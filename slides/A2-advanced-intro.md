<!-- Introduce today's subject -->
Advanced Rust syntax

# Ownership
We previously talked about ownership

* In rust there is always a single owner for each stack value
* Once the owner goes out of scope any associated values should be cleaned up
* Copy types creates copies, all other types are *moved*

<!--
- Note once more that the idea of moving is something that exists in the Rust
  world, but not necesarrily every move actually copies bytes around, these are
  all things where Rust's model is an abstraction over what the compiled code
  actually does.
-->

---

# Moving out of a function
We have previously seen this example


```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let len = calculate_length(s1);
    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}
fn calculate_length(s: String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

* This does not compile because ownership of `s1` is moved into
 `calculate_length`, meaning it is no longer available in `main` afterwards
* We can use `Clone` to create an explicit copy
* We can give ownership back by returning the value
* What about other options?

---

# Borrowing
- We can make an analogy with real life: if somebody owns something you can
  borrow it from them, but eventually you have to give it back
- If a value is borrowed, it is not moved and the ownership stays with the
  original owner
- To borrow in rust, we create a *reference*

```rust {all|3|7|all}
fn main() {
    let x = String::from("hello");
    let len = get_length(&x);
    println!("{}: {}", x, len);
}

fn get_length(arg: &String) -> usize {
    arg.len()
}
```

---

# References (immutable)

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    change(&s);
    println!("{}", s);
}

fn change(some_string: &String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```

- A mutable reference can even fully replace the original value
- To do this, you can use the dereference operator (`*`) to modify the value:

```rust
*some_string = String::from("Goodbye");
```

</v-click>

<!--
- We can use a mutable reference here to allow us to modify a borrowed value
- Note that you may also sometimes have to use the deref operator to access
  the value when reading it, but most of the time the Rust compiler will do
  this automatically and you need not worry about it.
-->

---


# Rules for borrowing and references

- You may only ever have one mutable reference at the same time
- You may have any number of immutable references at the same time as long as
  there is no mutable reference
- References cannot *live* longer than their owners
- A reference will always at all times point to a valid value

These rules can be checked by the Rust compiler.

<!--
- Rust tries to be smart about enforcing these rules, such that you don't notice
  them that often in real life usage, but there may be some cases that clearly
  appear valid, but Rust won't allow. There are generally pretty easy workarounds
  though
- Again: references are not pointers, but in practice of course they do look
  similar and are implemented the same way, but Rust's memory model is not the
  same as that of C/C++ and implementation is not the same as our model.
-->

---

# Borrowing and memory safety
Combined with the ownership model we can be sure that whole classes of errors
cannot occur.

* Rust is memory safe without having to use any runtime background proces such
  as a garbage collector
* But we still get the performance of a language that would normally let you
  manage memory manually

<!--
- Memory bugs such as: null pointer dereferences, data races, dangling pointers,
  use after free.

# Types redux
We have previously looked at some of the basic types in the Rust typesystem

- Primitives (integers, floats, booleans, characters)
- Compounds (tuples, arrays)
- Most of the types we looked at were `Copy`
- Borrowing will make more sense when we look at some more ways we can type
  our data

---

# Structuring data
Rust has two important ways to structure data

* structs
* enums
* ~~unions~~

<!--
- We have unions in Rust, but almost everywhere you will use enums instead.
  Unions become relevant once we start talking about FFI and unsafe Rust code.
-->

---

# Structs
A struct is similar to a tuple, but this time the combined type gets its own name

```rust
struct ControlPoint(f64, f64, bool);
```

<v-click>

This is an example of a *tuple struct*. You can access the fields in the struct
the same way as with tuples:

```rust
fn main() {
  let cp = ControlPoint(10.5, 12.3, true);
  println!("{}", cp.0); // prints 10.5
}
```

</v-click>

<!--
- Note that two tuples with the same fields in the same order are always the
  same type, whereas two structs with different names but the same fields are
  different types.
-->

---

# Structs
Much more common though are structs with named fields

```rust
struct ControlPoint {
  x: f64,
  y: f64,
  enabled: bool,
}
```

* We can add a little more purpose to each field
* No need to keep our indexing up to date when we add or remove a field

<v-click>


```rust {all|2-6|7}
fn main() {
  let cp = ControlPoint {
    x: 10.5,
    y: 12.3,
    enabled: true,
  };
  println!("{}", cp.x); // prints 10.5
}
```

</v-click>

<!--
- Named fields are especially easier in usage, as a type alone will most of
  the time not be enough information to determine the full meaning, here we now
  now that the two floats meant the x and y coordinates and we know what the
  boolean indicated.
- To instantiate (create a value) of a struct we use the syntax shown
- Now, we can use the same `x.y` syntax as with tuples, but we have a nice
  name for referencing our fields instead of having to remember the exact
  field index.
-->

---

# Enumerations
One of the more powerful kinds of types in Rust are enumerations

```rust
enum IpAddressType {
  Ipv4,
  Ipv6,
}
```

* An enumeration (listing) of different *variants*
* Each variant is an alternative value of the enum, you pick a single value to
  create an instance

<v-click>

```rust
fn main() {
  let ip_type = IpAddressType::Ipv4;
}
```

</v-click>

---

# Enumerations
But enums get more powerful, because each variant can have associated data with
it

```rust
enum IpAddress {
  Ipv4(u8, u8, u8, u8),
  Ipv6(u16, u16, u16, u16, u16, u16, u16, u16),
}
```

* This way, the associated data and the variant are bound together
* Impossible to create an ipv6 address while only giving a 32 bits integer

```rust
fn main() {
  let ipv4_home = IpAddress::Ipv4(127, 0, 0, 1);
  let ipv6_home = IpAddress::Ipv6(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1);
}
```

* Note: an enum always is as large as the largest variant

<div class="relative">

![Memory Layout](/images/A2-enum-memory.drawio.svg)

</div>

---

# Pattern matching
To extract data from enums we can use pattern matching using the
`if let [pattern] = [value]` statement

```rust
fn accept_ipv4(ip: IpAddress) {
  if let IpAddress::Ipv4(a, b, _, _) = ip {
    println!("Accepted, first octet is {} and second is {}", a, b);
  }
}
```

* `a` and `b` introduce local variables within the body of the if that contain
  the values of those fields
* The underscore (`_`) can be used to accept any value

---

# Match
But pattern matching is very powerful if combined with the match statement

```rust
fn accept_home(ip: IpAddress) {
  match ip {
    IpAddress::Ipv4(127, 0, 0, 1) => {
      println!("You are home!");
    },
    IpAddress::Ipv6(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1) => {
      println!("You are in your new home!");
    },
    _ => {
      println!("You are not home");
    },
}
```

* Every part of the match is called an arm
* A match is exhaustive, which means that all values must be handled by one of
  the match arms
* You can use a catch-all `_` arm to catch any remaining cases if there are any
  left

---

# Match as an expression
The match statement can even be used as an expression

```rust
fn get_first_byte(ip: IpAddress) {
  let first_byte = match ip {
    IpAddress::Ipv4(a, _, _, _) => a,
    IpAddress::Ipv6(a, _, _, _, _, _, _, _) => a / 256 as u8,
  };
  println!("The first byte was: {}", first_byte);
}
```

* The match arms can return a value, but their types have to match
* Note how here we do not need a catch all `_` arm because all cases have
  already been handled by the two arms

---

# Generics
Enums become even more powerful if we introduce a little of generics

```rust
struct PointFloat(f64, f64);
struct PointInt(i64, i64);
```

We are repeating ourselves here, what if we could write a datastructure for
both of these cases?

<v-click>

```rust
struct Point<T>(T, T);

fn main() {
  let float_point: Point<f64> = Point(10.0, 10.0);
  let int_point: Point<i64> = Point(10, 10);
}
```

Generics are much more powerful, but this is all we need for now

</v-click>

<!--
* The upper case letter between the angled brackets introduces a generic type
  parameter.
* We can now use that generic type variable we introduced as a type name
* Then at the point of using the type we can specify which actual type we
  want to use
* Generics are much more powerful, but this is enough for now
-->

---

# Option
A quick look into the basic enums available in the standard library

* Rust does not have null, but you can still define variables that optionally
  do not have a value
* For this you can use the `Option<T>` enum

```rust
enum Option<T> {
  Some(T),
  None,
}

fn main() {
  let some_int = Option::Some(42);
  let no_string: Option<String> = Option::None;
}
```

<!--
* Note how Rust can infer the type of `some_int`, but we have to specify what
  the type of the Option is in the None case, because it cannot possibly know
  what kind of values you could put in that Option
* Also not that for normal enums we have to import the variants, but Option
  is so common that the variants are available by default without needing to
  prefix them with `Option::`
-->

---

# Option
A quick look into the basic enums available in the standard library

* Rust does not have null, but you can still define variables that optionally
  do not have a value
* For this you can use the `Option<T>` enum

```rust
enum Option<T> {
  Some(T),
  None,
}

fn main() {
  let some_int = Some(42);
  let no_string: Option<String> = None;
}
```

---

# Error handling
What would we do when there is an error?

```rust
fn divide(x: i64, y: i64) -> i64 {
  if y == 0 {
    // what to do now?
  } else {
    x / y
  }
}
```

---

# Error handling
What would we do when there is an error?

```rust
fn divide(x: i64, y: i64) -> i64 {
  if y == 0 {
    panic!("Cannot divide by zero");
  } else {
    x / y
  }
}
```

* A panic in Rust is the most basic way to handle errors
* A panic error is an all or nothing kind of error
* A panic will immediately stop running the current thread/program and instead
  immediately work to shut it down, using one of two methods:
  * Unwinding: going up throught the stack and making sure that each value
    is cleaned up
  * Aborting: ignore everything and immediately exit the thread/program
* Only use panic in small programs if normal error handling would also exit
  the program
* Avoid using panic in library code or other reusable components

<!--
* Unwinding has its usages, mainly to clean up resources that you previously
  opened.
* An unwind can be stopped, but this is highly unusual to do and very expensive
* In a multithreaded program unwinding is essential to make sure that any
  memory owned by that thread is freed, making sure you don't have any memory
  leaks
* Rust programs are compiled such that if a panic does not occur, it doesn't
  add any extra cost, but that does mean that if a panic does occur, it isn't
  very fast
* Generally panicing should be avoided as much as possible
* The panic! macro is not the only way to trigger a panic, so beware, we will
  see some ways we can also trigger a panic very soon
* Note that if the main thread panics, the entire program will always exit
-->

---

# Error handling
What would we do when there is an error? We could try and use the option enum
instead of panicking

```rust
fn divide(x: i64, y: i64) -> Option<i64> {
  if y == 0 {
    None
  } else {
    Some(x / y)
  }
}
```

---

# Result
Another really powerful enum is the result, which is even more useful if we
think about error handling

```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
  Ok(T),
  Err(E),
}

enum DivideError {
  DivisionByZero,
  CannotDivideOne,
}

fn divide(x: i64, y: i64) -> Result<i64, DivideError> {
  if x == 1 {
    Err(DivideError::CannotDivideOne)
  } else if y == 0 {
    Err(DivideError::DivisionByZero)
  } else {
    Ok(x / y)
  }
}
```

---

# Handling results
Now that we have a function that returns a result we have to think about how
we handle that error at the call-site

```rust
fn div_zero_fails() {
  match divide(10, 0) {
    Ok(div) => println!("{}", div),
    Err(e) => panic!("Could not divide by zero"),
  }
}
```

* We made the signature of the `divide` function explicit in how it can fail
* The user of the function can now decide what to do, even if it is panicking
* Note: just as with `Option` we never have to use `Result::Ok` and
  `Result::Err` because they have been made available globally


<!--
- Note how in this case the error still causes a panic, but at least we get a
  choice of what we do
-->

---

# Handling results
Especially when writing initial prototyping code you will often find yourself
wanting to write error handling code later, Rust has a useful utility function
to help you for both `Option` and `Result`:

```rust
fn div_zero_fails() {
  let div = divide(10, 0).unwrap();
  println!("{}", div);
}
```

* Unwrap checks if the Result/Option is `Ok(x)` or `Some(x)` respectively and
  then return that `x`, otherwise it will panic your program with an error
  message
* Having unwraps all over the place is generally considered a bad practice
* Sometimes you can ensure that an error won't occur, in such cases `unwrap`
  can be a good solution

---

# Handling results
Especially when writing initial prototyping code you will often find yourself
wanting to write error handling code later, Rust has a useful utility function
to help you for both `Option` and `Result`:

```rust
fn div_zero_fails() {
  let div = divide(10, 0).unwrap_or(-1);
  println!("{}", div);
}
```

Besides unwrap, there are some other useful utility functions

- `unwrap_or(val)`: If there is an error, use the value given to unwrap_or
  instead
- `unwrap_or_default()`: Use the default value for that type if there is an
  error
- `expect(msg)`: Same as unwrap, but instead pass a custom error message
- `unwrap_or_else(fn)`: Same as unwrap_or, but instead call a function that
  generates a value in case of an error

<!--
* unwrap_or_else is mainly useful if generating a default value is an expensive
  operation
-->

---

# Result and the `?` operator
Results are so common that there is a special operator associated with them, the
`?` operator

```rust
fn can_fail() -> Result<i64, Error> {
  let intermediate_result = match divide(10, 0) {
    Ok(ir) => ir,
    Err(e) => return Err(e);
  };

  match divide(intermediate_result, 0) {
    Ok(sec) => Ok(sec * 2),
    Err(e) => Err(e),
  }
}
```

<v-click>

Look how this function changes if we use the `?` operator

```rust
fn can_fail() -> Result<i64, Error> {
  let intermediate_result = divide(10, 0)?;
  Ok(divide(intermediate_result, 0)? * 2)
}
```

</v-click>

---

# Result and the `?` operator

```rust
fn can_fail() -> Result<i64, Error> {
  let intermediate_result = divide(10, 0)?;
  Ok(divide(intermediate_result, 0)? * 2)
}
```

* The `?` operator does an implicit match, if there is an error, that error
  is then immediately returned and the function returns early
* If the result is `Ok()` then the value is extracted and we can continue right
  away

---

# Intermission: Impl blocks
In the past few slides we saw a syntax which wasn't explained before:

```rust {3}
fn main() {
  let x = Some(42);
  let unwrapped = x.unwrap();
  println!("{}", unwrapped);
}
```

* The syntax `x.y()` looks similar to how we accessed a field in a struct
* We can define functions on our types using impl blocks
* Impl blocks can be defined on any type, not just structs (with some limitations)

---

# Intermission: Impl blocks

```rust {all|6,13|7-12|7|17}
enum IpAddress {
  Ipv4(u8, u8, u8, u8),
  Ipv6(u16, u16, u16, u16, u16, u16, u16, u16),
}

impl IpAddress {
  fn as_u32(&self) -> Option<u32> {
    match self {
      IpAddress::Ipv4(a, b, c, d) => a << 24 + b << 16 + c << 8 + d
      _ => None,_
    }
  }
}

fn main() {
  let addr = IpAddress::Ipv4(127, 0, 0, 1);
  println!("{:?}", addr.as_u32());
}
```

<!--
- Here we define the as_u32 method
- Note how the impl block is separate from the type definition
- In fact we can have multiple impl blocks for the same type, as long as
  function definitions do not overlap (not useful right now, but it will be
  once we get more into generics)
-->

---

# Intermission: Impl blocks, self and Self

- The `self` parameter defines how the method can be used.
- The `Self` type is a shorthand for the type on which the current
  implementation is specified.

```rust {all|4-6|8-14|16-18}
struct Foo(i32);

impl Foo {
  fn consume(self) -> Self {
    Self(self.0 + 1)
  }

  fn borrow(&self) -> &i32 {
    &self.0
  }

  fn borrow_mut(&mut self) -> &mut i32 {
    &mut self.0
  }

  fn new() -> Self {
    Self(0)
  }
}
```

---

# Intermission: Impl blocks, the self parameter
The self parameter is called the *receiver*.

* The self parameter is always the first and it always has the type on which it
  was defined
* We never specify the type of the self parameter
* We can optionally prepend `&` or `&mut ` to self to indicate that we take
  a value by reference
* Absence of a self parameter means that the function is an associated function
  instead

```rust
fn main () {
  let mut f = Foo::new();
  println!("{}", f.borrow());
  *f.borrow_mut() = 10;
  let g = f.consume();
  println!("{}", g.borrow());
}
```

---

# Vec: storing more of the same
The vector is an array that can grow

* Compare this to the array we previously saw, which has a fixed size

```rust
fn main() {
  let arr = [1, 2];
  println!("{:?}", arr);

  let mut nums = Vec::new();
  nums.push(1);
  nums.push(2);
  println!("{:?}", nums);
}
```

---

# Vec
Vec is such a common type that there is an easy way to initialize
it with values that looks similar to arrays

```rust
fn main() {
  let mut nums = vec![1, 2];
  nums.push(3);
  println!("{:?}", nums);
}
```

---

# Vec: memory layout
How can a vector grow? Things on the stack need to be of a fixed size

<div class="relative left-130px">

![Memory Layout](/images/A2-vector-rust.drawio.svg)

</div>

<!--
- A Vec does this by allocating its contents on the heap as opposed to the
  stack-based storage of an array
- Think about what would happen if the capacity is full but we still want to
  add another element
-->

---

# Put it in a box
That pointer from the stack to the heap, how do we create such a thing?

* Boxing something is the way to create data that is stored on the heap
* A box uniquely owns that data, there is no one else that also owns the same
  data
* Even if the type inside the box is `Copy`, the box itself is not, move
  semantics apply to a box.

```rust
fn main() {
  // put an integer on the heap
  let boxed_int = Box::new(10);
}
```

<div class="relative left-170px">

![Memory Layout](/images/A2-box-in-memory.drawio.svg)

</div>

# Boxing
There are several reasons to box a variable on the heap

* When something is too large to move around
* We need something that is sized dynamically
* For writing recursive datastructures

```rust
struct Node {
  data: Vec<u8>,
  parent: Node,
}
```

- Especially if a move actually would involve memcopying the bits to another
  location in memory that would take way too long
- Of course the main reason that a vector uses the heap is to be able to be
  sized dynamically, but even so, a vector can be large, whereas an array will
  generally always have a limited size
-->

# Vectors and arrays
What if we wanted to write a sum function, we could define one for arrays of
a specific size:

```rust
fn sum(data: &[i64; 10]) -> i64 {
  let mut total = 0;
  for val in data {
    total += val;
  }
  total
}
```

---

# Vectors and arrays
Or one for just vectors:

```rust
fn sum(data: &Vec<i64>) -> i64 {
  let mut total = 0;
  for val in data {
    total += val;
  }
  total
}
```

---

# Slices
But what if we want something to work on arrays of any size? Or what if we want
to support summing up only parts of a vector?

* A slice is a dynamically sized view into a contiguous sequence
* Contiguous: elements are layed out in memory such that they are evenly spaced
* Dynamically sized: the size of the slice is not stored in the type, but is
  determined at runtime
* View: a slice is never an owned datastructure
* Slices are typed as `[T]`, where `T` is the type of the elements in the slice

---

# Slices

```rust
fn sum(data: [i64]) -> i64 {
  let mut total = 0;
  for val in data {
    total += val;
  }
  total
}

fn main() {
  let data = vec![10, 11, 12, 13, 14];
  println!("{}", sum(data));
}
```

# Slices

* `[T]` is an incomplete type: we need to know how many `T` there are
* Types that have a known compile time size implement the `Sized` trait, raw
  slices do **not** implement it
* Slices must always be behind a reference type, i.e. `&[T]` and `&mut [T]`
  (but also `Box<[T]>` etc)
* The length of the slice is always stored together with the reference

# Creating slices
Because we cannot create slices out of thin air, they have to be located
somewhere. There are three possible ways to create slices:

* Using a borrow
  - We can borrow from arrays and vectors to create a slice of their entire
    contents
* Using ranges
  - We can use ranges to create a slice from parts of a vector or array
* Using a literal (for immutable slices only)
  - We can have memory statically available from our compiled binary

---

# Creating slices
Using a borrow

```rust
fn sum(data: &[i32]) -> i32 { /* ... */ }

fn main() {
  let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
  let total = sum(&v);
  println!("{}", total);
}
```

---

# Creating slices
Using ranges

```rust
fn sum(data: &[i32]) -> i32 { /* ... */ }

fn main() {
  let v = vec![0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
  let all = sum(&v[..]);
  let except_first = sum(&v[1..]);
  let except_last = sum(&v[..5]);
  let except_ends = sum(&v[1..5]);
}
```

* The range `start..end` contains all values `x` with `start <= x < end`.

<v-click>

* Note: you can also use ranges on their own, for example in a for loop:

```rust
fn main() {
  for i in 0..10 {
    println!("{}", i);
  }
}
```

</v-click>

# Creating slices
From a literal

```rust {3-5,12|7-9,13|all}
fn sum(data: &[i32]) -> i32 { /* ... */ }

fn get_v_arr() -> &'static [i32] {
    &[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
}

fn get_v_vec() -> &'static [i32] {
    &vec![0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
}

fn main() {
  let all = sum(get_v_arr());
  let all_vec = sum(get_v_vec());
}
```

<v-click>

* Interestingly `get_v_arr` works, even though the literal looks like it would
  only exist temporarily
* Literals actually exist during the entire lifetime of the program
* `&'static` here is used to indicate that this slice will exist the entire
  lifetime of the program

# Strings
We have already seen the `String` type being used before, but let's dive a
little deeper

* Strings are used to represent text
* In Rust they are always valid UTF-8
* Their data is stored on the heap
* A String is almost the same as `Vec<u8>` with extra checks to prevent
  creating invalid text
<!--
- We store data on the heap so we can easily have strings of variable sizes
  and grow and shrink them as needed when they are modified.
- In general we really don't care about the exact length of the string
-->

---

# Strings
Let's take a look at some strings

```rust
fn main() {
  let s = String::from("Hello world\nSee you!");
  println!("{:?}", s.split_once(" "));
  println!("{}", s.len());
  println!("{:?}", s.starts_with("Hello"));
  println!("{}", s.to_uppercase());
  for line in s.lines() {
    println!("{}", line);
  }
}
```

---

# String literals
We have already seen string literals being used while constructing a string.
The string literal is what arrays are to vectors

```rust
fn main() {
  let s1 = "Hello world";
  let s2 = String::from("Hello world");
}
```

---

# String literals
We have already seen string literals being used while constructing a string.
The string literal is what arrays are to vectors

```rust
fn main() {
  let s1: &'static str = "Hello world";
  let s2: String = String::from("Hello world");
}
```

* `s1` is actually a slice, a string slice

---

# String literals
We have already seen string literals being used while constructing a string.
The string literal is what arrays are to vectors

```rust
fn main() {
  let s1: &str = "Hello world";
  let s2: String = String::from("Hello world");
}
```

* `s1` is actually a slice, a string slice

---

# str - the string slice
It should be possible to have a reference to part of a string. But what is it?

* Not `[u8]`: not every sequence of bytes is valid UTF-8
* Not `[char]`: we could not create a slice from a string since it is stored as
  UTF-8 encoded bytes
* We introduce a new special kind of slice: `str`
* For string slices we do not use brackets!

---

# str, String, array, Vec

| Static   | Dynamic  | Borrowed |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `[T; N]` | `Vec<T>` | `&[T]`   |
| -        | `String` | `&str`   |

* There is no static variant of str
* This would only be useful if we wanted strings of an extact length
* But just like we had the static slice literals, we can use `&'static str`
  literals for that instead!

---

# String or str
When do we use String and when do we use str?

```rust
fn string_len(data: &String) -> usize {
  data.len()
}
```

---

# String or str
When do we use String and when do we use str?

```rust
fn string_len(data: &str) -> usize {
  data.len()
}
```

* Prefer `&str` over `String` whenever possible
* If you need to mutate a string you might try `&mut str`, but you cannot
  change a slice's length
* Use `String` or `&mut String` if you need to fully mutate the string

---

# Summary

* Rust uses ownership and borrowing to give memory safety without a garbage collector
* Rust has structs and enums to structure your data
* Use `panic!`, `Result` and `Option` for handling errors and missing values
* Define methods and associated functions with impl blocks
* Use `Vec<T>` for growable array storage
* Use `Box<T>` to put something on the heap
* Use slices whenever possible instead of owned Vec and String types
