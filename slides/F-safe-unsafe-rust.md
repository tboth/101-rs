# Rust guarantees that references are valid

for any `&T` or `&mut T`

- the address is not `NULL`
- the address is well-aligned for type `T`
- it points into memory belonging to the process

These guarantees make rust memory safe

---
layout: default
---
# The borrow checker

The borrow + type checker ensures that these conditions are met

- We want a 100% guarantee that when the compiler says üëç
that really means our program is correct


- An analysis that is wrong in 1 out of 100 cases is worthless

---
layout: default

# The borrow checker is conservative

- "if it is not a hell yes, it's a no"

---
layout: default

# fail-proof borrow checker

```rust
fn borrow_checker<P>(program: P) -> bool {
    false
}
```

all programs that my borrow checker accepts are memory safe!

---
layout: default

# Hence

There are (many) correct programs that the rust borrow checker does not accept

# Hence

There are (many) **useful** programs that the rust borrow checker does not accept

# Unsafe, morally

In rust "unsafe" means "I, the programmer, am responsible for checking the correctness of this code"

The type and borrow checker are still in fully effect. But we can use types like raw pointers on which the conditions that the type/borrow checker places are less strict.

# Unsafe in code


- unsafe blocks: "programmer must check the rules"

```rust
// BAD!
let reference: &u8 = unsafe {
    let ptr = 0usize as *const u8;

    &*ptr
};
```

- unsafe functions: "programmer must check the preconditions"

```rust
unsafe fn foobar() {
    ...
}
```

- unsafe impl: "programmer must check impl is valid"

```rust
unsafe impl Send for MyType {}
```

---
layout: default
---
# Undefined Behavior & Optimizations

```rust
// std::hint::unreachable_unchecked
pub const unsafe fn unreachable_unchecked() -> !
```

- `unsafe fn`: to call this function, the programmer has to check the preconditions
- returns "never", the type of an infinite loop (diverging computation)

---
layout: default
---
# Undefined Behavior & Optimizations

```rust {all|2}
if expensive_pure_computation() == 0 {
    println!("hello there");
    unsafe { std::hint::unreachable_unchecked() }
} else {
    different_computation()
}
```

- that print is unreachable if the rest of the branch is unreachable

---
layout: default
---
# Undefined Behavior & Optimizations

```rust {all|2}
if expensive_pure_computation() == 0 {
    unsafe { std::hint::unreachable_unchecked() }
} else {
    different_computation()
}
```

- actually the whole branch is unreachable

---
layout: default
---
# Undefined Behavior & Optimizations

```rust
expensive_pure_computation() == 0;
different_computation()
```

- actually that whole condition does not need to be computed

---
layout: default
---
# Undefined Behavior & Optimizations

```rust {all|2}
if expensive_pure_computation() == 0 {
    println!("hello there");
    unsafe { std::hint::unreachable_unchecked() }
} else {
    different_computation()
}
```

becomes just

```rust
different_computation()
```

- but if the condition turns out to be reachable, behavior is confusing


---
layout: default
---
# Undefined Behavior & Optimizations

- misusing `unreachable_unchecked` is very explicit. There are many more subtle ways to introduce UB

```rust
// BAD!
let reference: &u8 = unsafe {
    let ptr = 0usize as *const u8;

    &*ptr
};
```

- the rust compiler assumes that references are valid, so this snippet contains UB!
- LLVM encodes and exploits assumptions like `nonnull` or `noalias`

```
define internal fastcc void @str.RocStr.reallocate(
    %str.RocStr* noalias nocapture nonnull %arg,
    %str.RocStr* nocapture nonnull readonly align 8 %arg1,
    i64 %arg2
)
```

# `transmute`

e.g. bitcast a `i64` into a `f64`:

```rust
std::mem::transmute::<i64, f64>(42i64)
```

there are still checks! `transmute` errors when the size does not correspond

```
error[E0512]: cannot transmute between types of different sizes, or dependently-sized types
 --> src/main.rs:2:12
  |
2 |   unsafe { std::mem::transmute::<i64, f32>(42i64) };
  |            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |
  = note: source type: `i64` (64 bits)
  = note: target type: `f32` (32 bits)
```

---
layout: default
---

# `transmute`

Only some bit patterns are valid for a type. Creating an invalid bit pattern is UB!

Only `0b0000_0000` and `0b0000_0001` are valid `bool` bit patterns. This code has UB:

```rust
std::mem::transmute::<u8, bool>(2u8)
```

An `if` statement might be compiled into a jump table

```rust
const JMP_TABLE: *const u8 = [ 0x1000, 0x1100 ];

// this will fail horribly if `bool_value >= 2`
jmp JMP_TABLE[bool_value as usize];
```

The memory representation of rust values is explicitly undefined! Bitcasting is therefore very unsafe!

# So Rust is just as bad as C?

- if memory safety can be broken, how is rust any better than C?

# So far 

- rust is a systems language: it must provide unrestricted access 
    * call code in different languages
    * exploit all capabilities of the OS/hardware
    * optimize
- rust's goals mean restricting access
- unsafe is an escape hatch: great power, but the risk of introducing UB

# Raw Pointers

```rust
let mut x = 0;
let y = &mut x as *mut i32;
let z = 12;

unsafe {
    std::ptr::write(y, z);
    assert_eq!(std::ptr::read(y), 12);
}
```

- raw (mut or const) pointers can alias each other!

---
layout: default

# NonNull

A `*mut T` that is guaranteed to not be NULL

```rust
use std::ptr::NonNull;

let mut x = 0u32;
let ptr = unsafe { NonNull::new_unchecked(&mut x as *mut _) };

// NEVER DO THIS!!! This is undefined behavior. ‚ö†Ô∏è
let ptr = unsafe { NonNull::<u32>::new_unchecked(std::ptr::null_mut()) };
```

# MaybeUninit

Working with uninitialized memory

```rust
use std::mem::MaybeUninit;

let b: bool = unsafe { MaybeUninit::uninit().assume_init() }; // undefined behavior! ‚ö†Ô∏è
```

- Useful when working with pointers (which may point to uninitialized data)

```rust
pub const unsafe fn swap<T>(x: *mut T, y: *mut T) {
    // Give ourselves some scratch space to work with.
    // We do not have to worry about drops: `MaybeUninit` does nothing when dropped.
    let mut tmp = MaybeUninit::<T>::uninit();

    // Perform the swap
    // SAFETY: the caller must guarantee that `x` and `y` are
    // valid for writes and properly aligned. `tmp` cannot be
    // overlapping either `x` or `y` because `tmp` was just allocated
    // on the stack as a separate allocated object.
    unsafe {
        std::ptr::copy_nonoverlapping(x, tmp.as_mut_ptr(), 1);
        std::ptr::copy(y, x, 1); // `x` and `y` may overlap
        std::ptr::copy_nonoverlapping(tmp.as_ptr(), y, 1);
    }
}
```

# CString

A null-terminated string type

use libc::strlen;

fn main() {
  let cstring = CString::new("Hello, world!").expect("no NULL bytes");

  // pub unsafe extern "C" fn strlen(cs: *const c_char) -> size_t
  println!("{}", unsafe { strlen(cstring.as_ptr())});
